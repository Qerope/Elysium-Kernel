# Elysium Kernel

Elysium Kernel is a consumer-ready operating system for RISC-V based devices, developed using a modified BSD kernel with emphasis on smooth and practical operation. It aims to provide a secure, efficient and flexible alternative for embedded and general-purpose computing, supporting a wide range of devices, from low-power IoT sensors to high-performance desktops.

## Features

Some of the key features of Elysium Kernel are:

- Full support for the RISC-V instruction set architecture, with custom extensions for hardware acceleration and security.
- Lightweight and modular design, with minimal dependencies and optimized resource usage.
- Built-in security features, such as memory protection, sandboxing and secure boot.
- User-friendly command-line interface, with standard POSIX utilities and custom tools for system management and troubleshooting.
- Compatibility with a wide range of hardware platforms, including popular development boards and single-board computers.
- Open-source license and community-driven development, with active contributions and feedback from users and developers.
